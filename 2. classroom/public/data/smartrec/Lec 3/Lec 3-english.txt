 But, as I told you earlier, it is a different script. Hello everyone, this is just an audio test and a video test whether our machine learning model is able to generate these transcripts professionally efficiently and correctly. So this is more or less about the video, there is nothing much to it. We will be just testing whether a whole base is working perfectly. I am along with my best co-founder, Eshwarya Ravi, who is been the backbone of the entire project.  working day and night to get this thing completed. So I'm really grateful to her and thank you very much everyone. I really want them to be great in terms of money. You can just do it. Thank you.
