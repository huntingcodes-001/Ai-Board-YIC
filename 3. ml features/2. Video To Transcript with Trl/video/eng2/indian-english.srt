1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,740
Once upon a time, in a village called Mahabaleshwar, there lived a rich man by name Balvinder Singh.

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,520
He had the only son by name Yashwant, who was inactive and non-focus towards life.

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:22,200
He had no interest in anything, so much that he did not even focus on his studies.

4
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,600
All he would do is roam with his friends all the day.

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,600
Then one day...

6
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,240
Son, Yashwant, concentrate on your studies now.

7
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,240
You are growing.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,280
Don't roam around with your friends all the time.

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,840
You need to study now.

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,000
Papa, why do I need to study at all?

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,680
As we are rich, and should I do a clerical job by studying now?

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,000
Why are you insisting me to study?

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,600
Son, Yashwant, knowledge is divine.

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,640
One should study to become wise, but not to do a clerical job.

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,720
One should know wise ways to live, and one can get it only through gurus.

16
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,400
There is a lot to learn in this world, my boy, and you should start paying attention,

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,400
alright?

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,840
Papa, I am not interested in studying, and please do not force me to study.

19
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,240
Please leave me alone.

20
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:21,160
Balvinder ponders upon how to change his son, as Yashwant is arrogant and not ready to study.

21
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,400
Meanwhile, his wife Amarbir comes there.

22
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,600
She sees him worried, and tries to convince him.

23
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,320
Please do not bother yourself.

24
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,240
He is our only son, and we have pampered him a lot.

25
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,640
He is still too young.

26
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,600
It will all be good with the passing time.

27
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,600
That's true.

28
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,520
We pampered him as he was a small boy.

29
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,600
But now, he is not.

30
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,680
If he continues to be a lazy bone, I am afraid of his future.

31
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,160
And he does not understand my intentions.

32
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,040
I am clueless about his future.

33
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,920
There is only one way out to get rid of this problem.

34
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,680
He must be away from us, and his friends.

35
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,480
That is the only solution I see for now, for him to realise the importance of life.

36
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,480
Oh God!

37
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,560
To send away our only child.

38
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,280
Can you stay without him?

39
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,920
We should take this tough decision for his good future.

40
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,400
Till now, we were pampering him.

41
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,720
But now, when we ask him to change, he sees us as his enemies.

42
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,560
So sending him away is the only solution.

43
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,440
Our love should help him to grow.

44
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,480
And that happens only when he studies well and away from us.

45
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,080
This is what I think.

46
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,360
Do you agree with this?

47
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,840
I like the idea.

48
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,360
But where can we get a teacher who can be patient with him, to teach him properly?

49
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,360
Of course.

50
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,360
We have Acharya Vishnu Sharma, the most efficient teacher in a nearby village.

51
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,080
Even my brother's son, Satbir, was mischievous like our son.

52
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,360
But now, he has changed a lot in his behaviour and attitude.

53
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,360
Hence, we will send our son also in his ashram.

54
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,360
Fine.

55
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,800
You talk to your son and crack the deal.

56
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,920
I will talk to Vishnu Sharmaji and take Yashwant to ashram, tomorrow itself.

57
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,920
Sure.

58
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,680
I will talk to my brother and find out details.

59
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,000
You start the preparations.

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Okay, I will.

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,480
After having a word with a husband about the admission and travel, Amarbeer thinks of

62
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,200
way to mend her son for the journey.

63
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,400
Meanwhile, Yashwant reaches home.

64
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,720
Seeing her mother in a state of deep thought, he asks her,

65
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,320
Maa, did you have your lunch?

66
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,320
Or are you waiting for me to turn up?

67
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,040
How could I have my meal without you, my dear son?

68
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,600
We both will have it together.

69
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,400
I overheard you and your father talking about something this morning.

70
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
What was that about?

71
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:42,560
Ah Maa, you always pesters me to study and does not listen to whatever I say.

72
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,560
No dear.

73
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,560
Do not say this.

74
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,560
You need to do something productive in life.

75
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,440
What should I do Maa?

76
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,440
Nothing Maa, son.

77
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:55,520
We have one of the best scholars in the world in our nearby village, by named Acharya Vishnu

78
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,680
Sharma.

79
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,160
Your father wants you to go there to pursue your education.

80
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,080
And I told him that you would never deny my desire, because I am sure you are ready

81
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,080
to go.

82
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,080
Am I right?

83
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,080
How come I will go Maa?

84
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,840
You know I am not interested in studies at all.

85
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,160
Don't worry my son.

86
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,040
You need not have to study there.

87
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,440
But just go with your father and observe the environment and you come back if you don't

88
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,440
like it.

89
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,280
Sure Maa, I will go because it is your desire and to stay away from father.

90
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,200
He scolds me and pesters me to study all the time.

91
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,840
I am going only because you are saying and if I don't like it, I will come back very

92
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,840
soon.

93
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,360
Yashwant decides to go to Vishnu Sharma's ashram only to escape from his father.

94
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:44,640
Accordingly, Balvinder sends a message to Guruji Vishnu Sharma about their arrival.

95
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,760
Acharya used to live there with a small family.

96
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,400
A wife named Lakshmi and a small son named Aditya.

97
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:59,360
Lakshmi, our Zameendal Mr. Balvinder is bringing his son, master Yashwant to our ashram.

98
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,680
He will stay with us until I make him a competent person.

99
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,360
All glory to God.

100
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,960
All your disciples have achieved big in life.

101
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:13,080
They have earned a good name for themselves in society all because of your education.

102
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,280
And now I suggest that you please start with the same process with our son Aditya too.

103
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,960
I think it's the right age.

104
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,560
Oh sure, why not?

105
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,600
I would love to have my son as my disciple.

106
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,760
I will start the training from tomorrow.

107
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:33,480
Next day Balvinder arrives at Vishnu Sharma's ashram with Yashwant.

108
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,680
He met Acharya and told him.

109
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:42,600
Namaskar Guruji, here is my son Yashwant and I am leaving him with you in your ashram.

110
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,040
Now it is your responsibility to shape him into a wise and competent person.

111
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:54,200
Sure Balvinder ji, in no time your son will excel in all the areas of competency.

112
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,240
Yashwant, you should concentrate on your studies.

113
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,840
If you do what I tell you to do, you will become wise and soon you will return home

114
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,200
as a wise boy.

115
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,640
And Yashwant, meet my son Aditya.

116
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:14,120
He is younger to you in age but I am starting the training along with you.

117
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,440
So you both should enjoy learning.

118
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,960
Now go inside the ashram.

119
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:23,120
After Yashwant goes inside the ashram, Balvinder starts talking to Acharya Vishnu Sharma and

120
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,120
requested.

121
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,880
Acharya, my son is your responsibility from today.

122
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,800
I request you to teach some common sense and culture to him.

123
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,800
Good God!

124
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,360
Why do you say that Balvinder ji?

125
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,000
Your son seems well mannered Acharya.

126
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,040
He is not the person as he seems.

127
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:46,680
He is lazy, stubborn and does not pay attention to what I say and he thinks me as his biggest

128
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,680
enemy.

129
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,720
Hence we thought of joining our son in your ashram and training.

130
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,560
I am worried about his future.

131
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,560
I am clueless.

132
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,720
How will you change and deal with him?

133
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,360
I hope he behaves himself with you here.

134
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,360
Don't you worry.

135
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,440
Yashwant is immature.

136
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,080
He will gradually learn everything and I am confident he will be responsible and competent

137
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,080
in no time.

138
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,080
He will be wiser when you see him next.

139
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,120
I have full faith in you Guru ji.

140
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,600
I will see you soon.

141
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,960
Balvinder takes leave from Acharya and starts proceeding towards home.

142
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,200
And from the very next day morning, training started for Yashwant.

143
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:32,120
So, Yashwant, I am starting your training from today and you will have to be prompt

144
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,760
in your approach and should do everything by yourself.

145
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,880
That is the way of my ashram.

146
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,920
You will have to abide by rules.

147
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,920
Understand?

148
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:46,760
Yashwant bursts in anger after listening to Guru ji's words.

149
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,040
In a deeply saddened tone, he told Guru ji,

150
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:56,080
Guru ji, you are also like father, always dictating me what to do and when to do.

151
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,800
I came here to stay away from such instructions.

152
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,520
I don't want to do anything.

153
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,880
Is that so?

154
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,440
But you cannot shout at me like this way.

155
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:11,040
This is not your house and you will have to face the music if you do not follow my instructions.

156
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,040
Understand boy?

157
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,440
Acharya said in a stern voice,

158
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,280
Yashwant follows half-heartedly whatever the Guru instructs as he does not want to

159
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,360
go back to his father.

160
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,080
That's why there was no other way out.

161
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,560
Then one fine day,

162
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,800
Yashwant, I asked you to buy a heart a shlok yesterday and reproduce the same today.

163
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,800
Did you do that?

164
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,880
Guru ji, I have not learnt it yet.

165
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,880
Okay?

166
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,680
Don't you understand what I say?

167
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:46,240
I reiterated that you would have to face a punishment if you do not follow what I say

168
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:52,920
and read aloud the shlok for 100 times today and that is your punishment.

169
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,280
All this became an everyday routine.

170
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,680
However, Yashwant started to follow whatever Acharya said.

171
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,040
Over the period, he developed hatred towards this Guru, thinking that his Guru is consciously

172
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,840
forcing him to do all nonsense and his Guru does not love him at all.

173
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,960
This routine follows for a couple of more days.

174
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,560
Then one fine day,

175
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,880
Yashwant, we are going for a marriage to a nearby village.

176
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,560
Take care of yourself and Aditya.

177
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,040
Ask him to buy a heart all the shloks.

178
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:29,080
If you do not remind him about the shloks, he will play all throughout the day.

179
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,000
Play outside and waste his time.

180
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,960
I don't want that happening.

181
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,960
Alright?

182
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,520
Will you do that?

183
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,880
I will take care Guru ji.

184
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,840
Giving Aditya's responsibility to Yashwant, Vishnu Sharma leaves along with his wife to

185
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,080
a nearby village for a marriage.

186
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,480
And Yashwant deems it as a respect to take up the responsibility of his Guru's son.

187
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,480
He said,

188
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,840
Listen Aditya, Guru ji has assigned me your responsibility, so you should obey whatever

189
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,080
I say until he comes back.

190
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,600
Do you understand that?

191
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,600
Tell me.

192
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:08,680
Yes my dear brother, but I want to play now, so please leave me and let me play a little.

193
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,720
My dear little brother, I cannot allow you to play until you buy a heart all the shloks

194
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,720
for the day.

195
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:21,360
Yashwant tries his level best to mend Aditya and let him learn the shloka by showing his

196
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,360
authority.

197
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:28,760
But even after four days, Aditya could not get the shloka by heart, as his entire concentration

198
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,200
was on playing.

199
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,840
Evidently, Yashwant was very upset about this.

200
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,840
What is this Aditya?

201
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,400
How come you are unable to learn a small shloka despite being the son to a scholar?

202
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,280
If you do not read the shloka now, then I will have to punish you.

203
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:49,760
So please read it Aditya, brother, nothing is going into my head, please leave me.

204
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,000
Let me play.

205
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,640
This way Aditya does not pay attention to Yashwant's words and does not concentrate

206
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,320
on his studies and plays all the time.

207
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,800
However, Yashwant wants to try his luck for one final time.

208
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:10,400
So he calls up Aditya and tells him, Aditya, if you do not recite the shloka today, I

209
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,960
will punish you.

210
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,960
Understand?

211
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,240
You do whatever you want.

212
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,560
I cannot study and I will not recite the shloka.

213
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:24,440
Yaring up on such an arrogant answer, Yashwant loses his temper and slaps Aditya.

214
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,760
The slap was so hard that his cheek turned red.

215
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,520
Little Aditya went inside crying and started learning shloka.

216
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,720
Oh God, I slapped my Guru's son out of anger.

217
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,880
Now what will happen?

218
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,440
What will happen now?

219
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,520
Yashwant was terrified and lost in his thoughts.

220
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:48,400
But he observed that Aditya started reading with utmost concentration.

221
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,200
Very next day, Acharya Vishnu Sharma returned home along with his wife.

222
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,720
Subsequently, Aditya complained about Yashwant slapping him on the face.

223
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,600
Ma, ma, see, how brother slapped on my face.

224
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,960
It swelled too and it hurts a lot.

225
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,520
Oh my God, Yashwant, why did you slap this hurt?

226
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,640
It's hurt him so bad, his cheeks are red like apple.

227
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:17,280
Ma, I warned him many a times to recite the shloka, but he did not pay an ear to what

228
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,720
I said and played all the time.

229
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,920
So to bring him back on track, I had to slap him.

230
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:32,400
What do you expect me to say?

231
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,920
I entrusted Aditya's responsibility to Yashwant and he did his duty.

232
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,400
He asked our son to recite the shloka, to which he denied, so there is no other way

233
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,960
for a Guru rather than to punish the student.

234
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:50,160
One can pamper the kid in all other aspects, but not in studies.

235
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,440
One is not a teacher if they do not discipline the student.

236
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,040
As a teacher, one wants all the disciples to progress and achieve greater heights in

237
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,040
life.

238
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,040
Yashwant also did the same.

239
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,040
You go inside.

240
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,040
I will talk to Yashwant.

241
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:09,280
While listening to their conversation, Yashwant understood his Guru's intentions and remembered

242
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,520
his father, who tried to sort the issue with love.

243
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:18,040
His father wanted to see him grow and reach heights, but he never paid attention.

244
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,520
Acharya, you should forgive my ignorance.

245
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,200
I never understood your good intentions.

246
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,280
I developed hatred upon you and always thought you are persisting me to study, but never

247
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,480
realized it is for my bright future.

248
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,480
Now I will study hard, Guruji.

249
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,720
Yashwant, you should apologize to your parents, not to me.

250
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,040
Remember, parents are our first teachers.

251
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,360
They always wish child's good and bright future.

252
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,080
If you become wise and cultured, you would be the one to be benefited.

253
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,360
Without realizing this, you hated your parents.

254
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,440
The one who wants you to achieve greater heights will fight for your good and wants to choose

255
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,400
good and wise path.

256
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,320
Remember so as you reap.

257
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,000
Concentrate on your studies and do well in life.

258
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,800
Acharyaji, I am indebted to you.

259
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,480
Thank you for your lessons.

260
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:19,000
From that day onwards, he followed the footsteps of his Guru and completed his education within

261
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,920
no time and returned to his village.

262
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,960
Upon his return, he took all the responsibilities from his parents and looked after them happily

263
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,960
forever.
