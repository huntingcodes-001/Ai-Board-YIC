00:00.000 --> 00:10.740
Once upon a time, in a village called Mahabaleshwar, there lived a rich man by name Balvinder Singh.

00:10.740 --> 00:16.520
He had the only son by name Yashwant, who was inactive and non-focus towards life.

00:16.520 --> 00:22.200
He had no interest in anything, so much that he did not even focus on his studies.

00:22.200 --> 00:25.600
All he would do is roam with his friends all the day.

00:25.600 --> 00:26.600
Then one day...

00:26.600 --> 00:31.240
Son, Yashwant, concentrate on your studies now.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.240
You are growing.

00:32.240 --> 00:35.280
Don't roam around with your friends all the time.

00:35.280 --> 00:36.840
You need to study now.

00:36.840 --> 00:40.000
Papa, why do I need to study at all?

00:40.000 --> 00:43.680
As we are rich, and should I do a clerical job by studying now?

00:43.680 --> 00:46.000
Why are you insisting me to study?

00:46.000 --> 00:49.600
Son, Yashwant, knowledge is divine.

00:49.600 --> 00:54.640
One should study to become wise, but not to do a clerical job.

00:54.640 --> 01:00.720
One should know wise ways to live, and one can get it only through gurus.

01:00.720 --> 01:05.400
There is a lot to learn in this world, my boy, and you should start paying attention,

01:05.400 --> 01:06.400
alright?

01:06.400 --> 01:12.840
Papa, I am not interested in studying, and please do not force me to study.

01:12.840 --> 01:15.240
Please leave me alone.

01:15.240 --> 01:21.160
Balvinder ponders upon how to change his son, as Yashwant is arrogant and not ready to study.

01:21.280 --> 01:24.400
Meanwhile, his wife Amarbir comes there.

01:24.400 --> 01:28.600
She sees him worried, and tries to convince him.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.320
Please do not bother yourself.

01:30.320 --> 01:33.240
He is our only son, and we have pampered him a lot.

01:33.240 --> 01:34.640
He is still too young.

01:34.640 --> 01:36.600
It will all be good with the passing time.

01:36.600 --> 01:37.600
That's true.

01:37.600 --> 01:40.520
We pampered him as he was a small boy.

01:40.520 --> 01:42.600
But now, he is not.

01:42.600 --> 01:46.680
If he continues to be a lazy bone, I am afraid of his future.

01:46.680 --> 01:49.160
And he does not understand my intentions.

01:49.160 --> 01:51.040
I am clueless about his future.

01:51.040 --> 01:54.920
There is only one way out to get rid of this problem.

01:54.920 --> 01:57.680
He must be away from us, and his friends.

01:57.680 --> 02:02.480
That is the only solution I see for now, for him to realise the importance of life.

02:02.480 --> 02:03.480
Oh God!

02:03.480 --> 02:06.560
To send away our only child.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.280
Can you stay without him?

02:08.280 --> 02:11.920
We should take this tough decision for his good future.

02:11.920 --> 02:14.400
Till now, we were pampering him.

02:14.400 --> 02:18.720
But now, when we ask him to change, he sees us as his enemies.

02:18.720 --> 02:21.560
So sending him away is the only solution.

02:21.560 --> 02:23.440
Our love should help him to grow.

02:23.440 --> 02:27.480
And that happens only when he studies well and away from us.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.080
This is what I think.

02:29.080 --> 02:30.360
Do you agree with this?

02:30.360 --> 02:31.840
I like the idea.

02:31.840 --> 02:37.360
But where can we get a teacher who can be patient with him, to teach him properly?

02:37.360 --> 02:38.360
Of course.

02:38.360 --> 02:43.360
We have Acharya Vishnu Sharma, the most efficient teacher in a nearby village.

02:43.360 --> 02:47.080
Even my brother's son, Satbir, was mischievous like our son.

02:47.080 --> 02:50.360
But now, he has changed a lot in his behaviour and attitude.

02:50.360 --> 02:53.360
Hence, we will send our son also in his ashram.

02:53.360 --> 02:54.360
Fine.

02:54.360 --> 02:56.800
You talk to your son and crack the deal.

02:56.800 --> 03:01.920
I will talk to Vishnu Sharmaji and take Yashwant to ashram, tomorrow itself.

03:01.920 --> 03:02.920
Sure.

03:02.920 --> 03:05.680
I will talk to my brother and find out details.

03:05.680 --> 03:07.000
You start the preparations.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Okay, I will.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.480
After having a word with a husband about the admission and travel, Amarbeer thinks of

03:13.480 --> 03:16.200
way to mend her son for the journey.

03:16.320 --> 03:18.400
Meanwhile, Yashwant reaches home.

03:18.400 --> 03:21.720
Seeing her mother in a state of deep thought, he asks her,

03:21.720 --> 03:24.320
Maa, did you have your lunch?

03:24.320 --> 03:26.320
Or are you waiting for me to turn up?

03:26.320 --> 03:29.040
How could I have my meal without you, my dear son?

03:29.040 --> 03:30.600
We both will have it together.

03:30.600 --> 03:34.400
I overheard you and your father talking about something this morning.

03:34.400 --> 03:35.400
What was that about?

03:35.400 --> 03:42.560
Ah Maa, you always pesters me to study and does not listen to whatever I say.

03:42.560 --> 03:43.560
No dear.

03:43.560 --> 03:44.560
Do not say this.

03:45.040 --> 03:47.560
You need to do something productive in life.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.440
What should I do Maa?

03:49.440 --> 03:50.440
Nothing Maa, son.

03:50.440 --> 03:55.520
We have one of the best scholars in the world in our nearby village, by named Acharya Vishnu

03:55.520 --> 03:56.680
Sharma.

03:56.680 --> 04:00.160
Your father wants you to go there to pursue your education.

04:00.160 --> 04:05.080
And I told him that you would never deny my desire, because I am sure you are ready

04:05.080 --> 04:06.080
to go.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.080
Am I right?

04:07.080 --> 04:08.080
How come I will go Maa?

04:08.080 --> 04:10.840
You know I am not interested in studies at all.

04:10.840 --> 04:12.160
Don't worry my son.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.040
You need not have to study there.

04:14.040 --> 04:18.440
But just go with your father and observe the environment and you come back if you don't

04:18.440 --> 04:19.440
like it.

04:19.440 --> 04:24.280
Sure Maa, I will go because it is your desire and to stay away from father.

04:24.280 --> 04:28.200
He scolds me and pesters me to study all the time.

04:28.200 --> 04:33.840
I am going only because you are saying and if I don't like it, I will come back very

04:33.840 --> 04:34.840
soon.

04:34.840 --> 04:39.360
Yashwant decides to go to Vishnu Sharma's ashram only to escape from his father.

04:39.480 --> 04:44.640
Accordingly, Balvinder sends a message to Guruji Vishnu Sharma about their arrival.

04:44.640 --> 04:47.760
Acharya used to live there with a small family.

04:47.760 --> 04:52.400
A wife named Lakshmi and a small son named Aditya.

04:52.400 --> 04:59.360
Lakshmi, our Zameendal Mr. Balvinder is bringing his son, master Yashwant to our ashram.

04:59.360 --> 05:03.680
He will stay with us until I make him a competent person.

05:03.680 --> 05:05.360
All glory to God.

05:05.360 --> 05:07.960
All your disciples have achieved big in life.

05:07.960 --> 05:13.080
They have earned a good name for themselves in society all because of your education.

05:13.080 --> 05:18.280
And now I suggest that you please start with the same process with our son Aditya too.

05:18.280 --> 05:19.960
I think it's the right age.

05:19.960 --> 05:22.560
Oh sure, why not?

05:22.560 --> 05:25.600
I would love to have my son as my disciple.

05:25.600 --> 05:28.760
I will start the training from tomorrow.

05:28.760 --> 05:33.480
Next day Balvinder arrives at Vishnu Sharma's ashram with Yashwant.

05:33.480 --> 05:36.680
He met Acharya and told him.

05:36.760 --> 05:42.600
Namaskar Guruji, here is my son Yashwant and I am leaving him with you in your ashram.

05:42.600 --> 05:48.040
Now it is your responsibility to shape him into a wise and competent person.

05:48.040 --> 05:54.200
Sure Balvinder ji, in no time your son will excel in all the areas of competency.

05:54.200 --> 05:57.240
Yashwant, you should concentrate on your studies.

05:57.240 --> 06:02.840
If you do what I tell you to do, you will become wise and soon you will return home

06:02.840 --> 06:04.200
as a wise boy.

06:04.600 --> 06:09.640
And Yashwant, meet my son Aditya.

06:09.640 --> 06:14.120
He is younger to you in age but I am starting the training along with you.

06:14.120 --> 06:16.440
So you both should enjoy learning.

06:16.440 --> 06:17.960
Now go inside the ashram.

06:17.960 --> 06:23.120
After Yashwant goes inside the ashram, Balvinder starts talking to Acharya Vishnu Sharma and

06:23.120 --> 06:24.120
requested.

06:24.120 --> 06:27.880
Acharya, my son is your responsibility from today.

06:27.880 --> 06:31.800
I request you to teach some common sense and culture to him.

06:31.800 --> 06:32.800
Good God!

06:33.200 --> 06:35.360
Why do you say that Balvinder ji?

06:35.360 --> 06:38.000
Your son seems well mannered Acharya.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.040
He is not the person as he seems.

06:40.040 --> 06:46.680
He is lazy, stubborn and does not pay attention to what I say and he thinks me as his biggest

06:46.680 --> 06:47.680
enemy.

06:47.680 --> 06:51.720
Hence we thought of joining our son in your ashram and training.

06:51.720 --> 06:53.560
I am worried about his future.

06:53.560 --> 06:54.560
I am clueless.

06:54.560 --> 06:56.720
How will you change and deal with him?

06:56.720 --> 06:59.360
I hope he behaves himself with you here.

06:59.360 --> 07:01.360
Don't you worry.

07:01.440 --> 07:03.440
Yashwant is immature.

07:03.440 --> 07:09.080
He will gradually learn everything and I am confident he will be responsible and competent

07:09.080 --> 07:10.080
in no time.

07:10.080 --> 07:12.080
He will be wiser when you see him next.

07:12.080 --> 07:14.120
I have full faith in you Guru ji.

07:14.120 --> 07:15.600
I will see you soon.

07:15.600 --> 07:20.960
Balvinder takes leave from Acharya and starts proceeding towards home.

07:20.960 --> 07:26.200
And from the very next day morning, training started for Yashwant.

07:26.200 --> 07:32.120
So, Yashwant, I am starting your training from today and you will have to be prompt

07:32.120 --> 07:36.760
in your approach and should do everything by yourself.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.880
That is the way of my ashram.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.920
You will have to abide by rules.

07:40.920 --> 07:41.920
Understand?

07:41.920 --> 07:46.760
Yashwant bursts in anger after listening to Guru ji's words.

07:46.760 --> 07:50.040
In a deeply saddened tone, he told Guru ji,

07:50.040 --> 07:56.080
Guru ji, you are also like father, always dictating me what to do and when to do.

07:56.120 --> 07:58.800
I came here to stay away from such instructions.

07:58.800 --> 08:00.520
I don't want to do anything.

08:00.520 --> 08:01.880
Is that so?

08:01.880 --> 08:04.440
But you cannot shout at me like this way.

08:04.440 --> 08:11.040
This is not your house and you will have to face the music if you do not follow my instructions.

08:11.040 --> 08:13.040
Understand boy?

08:13.040 --> 08:15.440
Acharya said in a stern voice,

08:15.440 --> 08:20.280
Yashwant follows half-heartedly whatever the Guru instructs as he does not want to

08:20.280 --> 08:22.360
go back to his father.

08:22.360 --> 08:25.080
That's why there was no other way out.

08:25.080 --> 08:26.560
Then one fine day,

08:26.560 --> 08:32.800
Yashwant, I asked you to buy a heart a shlok yesterday and reproduce the same today.

08:32.800 --> 08:33.800
Did you do that?

08:33.800 --> 08:36.880
Guru ji, I have not learnt it yet.

08:36.880 --> 08:37.880
Okay?

08:37.880 --> 08:40.680
Don't you understand what I say?

08:40.680 --> 08:46.240
I reiterated that you would have to face a punishment if you do not follow what I say

08:46.240 --> 08:52.920
and read aloud the shlok for 100 times today and that is your punishment.

08:52.920 --> 08:55.280
All this became an everyday routine.

08:55.280 --> 08:59.680
However, Yashwant started to follow whatever Acharya said.

08:59.680 --> 09:05.040
Over the period, he developed hatred towards this Guru, thinking that his Guru is consciously

09:05.040 --> 09:09.840
forcing him to do all nonsense and his Guru does not love him at all.

09:09.840 --> 09:12.960
This routine follows for a couple of more days.

09:12.960 --> 09:14.560
Then one fine day,

09:14.560 --> 09:18.880
Yashwant, we are going for a marriage to a nearby village.

09:18.880 --> 09:21.560
Take care of yourself and Aditya.

09:21.560 --> 09:24.040
Ask him to buy a heart all the shloks.

09:24.040 --> 09:29.080
If you do not remind him about the shloks, he will play all throughout the day.

09:29.080 --> 09:32.000
Play outside and waste his time.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.960
I don't want that happening.

09:33.960 --> 09:34.960
Alright?

09:34.960 --> 09:36.520
Will you do that?

09:36.520 --> 09:38.880
I will take care Guru ji.

09:38.880 --> 09:43.840
Giving Aditya's responsibility to Yashwant, Vishnu Sharma leaves along with his wife to

09:43.840 --> 09:46.080
a nearby village for a marriage.

09:46.080 --> 09:51.480
And Yashwant deems it as a respect to take up the responsibility of his Guru's son.

09:51.480 --> 09:52.480
He said,

09:52.480 --> 09:57.840
Listen Aditya, Guru ji has assigned me your responsibility, so you should obey whatever

09:57.840 --> 10:00.080
I say until he comes back.

10:00.080 --> 10:01.600
Do you understand that?

10:01.600 --> 10:02.600
Tell me.

10:02.600 --> 10:08.680
Yes my dear brother, but I want to play now, so please leave me and let me play a little.

10:09.680 --> 10:14.720
My dear little brother, I cannot allow you to play until you buy a heart all the shloks

10:14.720 --> 10:15.720
for the day.

10:15.720 --> 10:21.360
Yashwant tries his level best to mend Aditya and let him learn the shloka by showing his

10:21.360 --> 10:22.360
authority.

10:22.360 --> 10:28.760
But even after four days, Aditya could not get the shloka by heart, as his entire concentration

10:28.760 --> 10:30.200
was on playing.

10:30.200 --> 10:33.840
Evidently, Yashwant was very upset about this.

10:33.840 --> 10:34.840
What is this Aditya?

10:35.000 --> 10:39.400
How come you are unable to learn a small shloka despite being the son to a scholar?

10:39.400 --> 10:43.280
If you do not read the shloka now, then I will have to punish you.

10:43.280 --> 10:49.760
So please read it Aditya, brother, nothing is going into my head, please leave me.

10:49.760 --> 10:52.000
Let me play.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.640
This way Aditya does not pay attention to Yashwant's words and does not concentrate

10:56.640 --> 10:59.320
on his studies and plays all the time.

10:59.320 --> 11:03.800
However, Yashwant wants to try his luck for one final time.

11:03.800 --> 11:10.400
So he calls up Aditya and tells him, Aditya, if you do not recite the shloka today, I

11:10.400 --> 11:11.960
will punish you.

11:11.960 --> 11:12.960
Understand?

11:12.960 --> 11:14.240
You do whatever you want.

11:14.240 --> 11:17.560
I cannot study and I will not recite the shloka.

11:17.560 --> 11:24.440
Yaring up on such an arrogant answer, Yashwant loses his temper and slaps Aditya.

11:24.440 --> 11:28.760
The slap was so hard that his cheek turned red.

11:28.760 --> 11:32.520
Little Aditya went inside crying and started learning shloka.

11:32.960 --> 11:36.720
Oh God, I slapped my Guru's son out of anger.

11:36.720 --> 11:38.880
Now what will happen?

11:38.880 --> 11:40.440
What will happen now?

11:40.440 --> 11:43.520
Yashwant was terrified and lost in his thoughts.

11:43.520 --> 11:48.400
But he observed that Aditya started reading with utmost concentration.

11:48.400 --> 11:53.200
Very next day, Acharya Vishnu Sharma returned home along with his wife.

11:53.200 --> 11:57.720
Subsequently, Aditya complained about Yashwant slapping him on the face.

11:57.720 --> 12:01.600
Ma, ma, see, how brother slapped on my face.

12:01.600 --> 12:04.960
It swelled too and it hurts a lot.

12:04.960 --> 12:08.520
Oh my God, Yashwant, why did you slap this hurt?

12:08.520 --> 12:11.640
It's hurt him so bad, his cheeks are red like apple.

12:11.640 --> 12:17.280
Ma, I warned him many a times to recite the shloka, but he did not pay an ear to what

12:17.280 --> 12:19.720
I said and played all the time.

12:19.720 --> 12:23.920
So to bring him back on track, I had to slap him.

12:23.920 --> 12:32.400
What do you expect me to say?

12:32.400 --> 12:37.920
I entrusted Aditya's responsibility to Yashwant and he did his duty.

12:37.920 --> 12:42.400
He asked our son to recite the shloka, to which he denied, so there is no other way

12:42.400 --> 12:45.960
for a Guru rather than to punish the student.

12:45.960 --> 12:50.160
One can pamper the kid in all other aspects, but not in studies.

12:50.160 --> 12:53.440
One is not a teacher if they do not discipline the student.

12:53.440 --> 12:58.040
As a teacher, one wants all the disciples to progress and achieve greater heights in

12:58.040 --> 12:59.040
life.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.040
Yashwant also did the same.

13:01.040 --> 13:02.040
You go inside.

13:02.040 --> 13:04.040
I will talk to Yashwant.

13:04.040 --> 13:09.280
While listening to their conversation, Yashwant understood his Guru's intentions and remembered

13:09.280 --> 13:12.520
his father, who tried to sort the issue with love.

13:12.520 --> 13:18.040
His father wanted to see him grow and reach heights, but he never paid attention.

13:19.040 --> 13:22.520
Acharya, you should forgive my ignorance.

13:22.520 --> 13:25.200
I never understood your good intentions.

13:25.200 --> 13:30.280
I developed hatred upon you and always thought you are persisting me to study, but never

13:30.280 --> 13:33.480
realized it is for my bright future.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.480
Now I will study hard, Guruji.

13:35.480 --> 13:39.720
Yashwant, you should apologize to your parents, not to me.

13:39.720 --> 13:43.040
Remember, parents are our first teachers.

13:43.040 --> 13:46.360
They always wish child's good and bright future.

13:46.360 --> 13:51.080
If you become wise and cultured, you would be the one to be benefited.

13:51.080 --> 13:54.360
Without realizing this, you hated your parents.

13:54.360 --> 13:59.440
The one who wants you to achieve greater heights will fight for your good and wants to choose

13:59.440 --> 14:01.400
good and wise path.

14:01.400 --> 14:04.320
Remember so as you reap.

14:04.320 --> 14:08.000
Concentrate on your studies and do well in life.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.800
Acharyaji, I am indebted to you.

14:10.800 --> 14:13.480
Thank you for your lessons.

14:13.480 --> 14:19.000
From that day onwards, he followed the footsteps of his Guru and completed his education within

14:19.000 --> 14:21.920
no time and returned to his village.

14:21.920 --> 14:26.960
Upon his return, he took all the responsibilities from his parents and looked after them happily

14:26.960 --> 14:27.960
forever.

14:27.960 --> 14:32.080
