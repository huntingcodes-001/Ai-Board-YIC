0	10740	Once upon a time, in a village called Mahabaleshwar, there lived a rich man by name Balvinder Singh.
10740	16520	He had the only son by name Yashwant, who was inactive and non-focus towards life.
16520	22200	He had no interest in anything, so much that he did not even focus on his studies.
22200	25600	All he would do is roam with his friends all the day.
25600	26600	Then one day...
26600	31240	Son, Yashwant, concentrate on your studies now.
31240	32240	You are growing.
32240	35280	Don't roam around with your friends all the time.
35280	36840	You need to study now.
36840	40000	Papa, why do I need to study at all?
40000	43680	As we are rich, and should I do a clerical job by studying now?
43680	46000	Why are you insisting me to study?
46000	49600	Son, Yashwant, knowledge is divine.
49600	54640	One should study to become wise, but not to do a clerical job.
54640	60720	One should know wise ways to live, and one can get it only through gurus.
60720	65400	There is a lot to learn in this world, my boy, and you should start paying attention,
65400	66400	alright?
66400	72840	Papa, I am not interested in studying, and please do not force me to study.
72840	75240	Please leave me alone.
75240	81160	Balvinder ponders upon how to change his son, as Yashwant is arrogant and not ready to study.
81280	84400	Meanwhile, his wife Amarbir comes there.
84400	88600	She sees him worried, and tries to convince him.
88600	90320	Please do not bother yourself.
90320	93240	He is our only son, and we have pampered him a lot.
93240	94640	He is still too young.
94640	96600	It will all be good with the passing time.
96600	97600	That's true.
97600	100520	We pampered him as he was a small boy.
100520	102600	But now, he is not.
102600	106680	If he continues to be a lazy bone, I am afraid of his future.
106680	109160	And he does not understand my intentions.
109160	111040	I am clueless about his future.
111040	114920	There is only one way out to get rid of this problem.
114920	117680	He must be away from us, and his friends.
117680	122480	That is the only solution I see for now, for him to realise the importance of life.
122480	123480	Oh God!
123480	126560	To send away our only child.
126560	128280	Can you stay without him?
128280	131920	We should take this tough decision for his good future.
131920	134400	Till now, we were pampering him.
134400	138720	But now, when we ask him to change, he sees us as his enemies.
138720	141560	So sending him away is the only solution.
141560	143440	Our love should help him to grow.
143440	147480	And that happens only when he studies well and away from us.
147480	149080	This is what I think.
149080	150360	Do you agree with this?
150360	151840	I like the idea.
151840	157360	But where can we get a teacher who can be patient with him, to teach him properly?
157360	158360	Of course.
158360	163360	We have Acharya Vishnu Sharma, the most efficient teacher in a nearby village.
163360	167080	Even my brother's son, Satbir, was mischievous like our son.
167080	170360	But now, he has changed a lot in his behaviour and attitude.
170360	173360	Hence, we will send our son also in his ashram.
173360	174360	Fine.
174360	176800	You talk to your son and crack the deal.
176800	181920	I will talk to Vishnu Sharmaji and take Yashwant to ashram, tomorrow itself.
181920	182920	Sure.
182920	185680	I will talk to my brother and find out details.
185680	187000	You start the preparations.
187000	189000	Okay, I will.
189000	193480	After having a word with a husband about the admission and travel, Amarbeer thinks of
193480	196200	way to mend her son for the journey.
196320	198400	Meanwhile, Yashwant reaches home.
198400	201720	Seeing her mother in a state of deep thought, he asks her,
201720	204320	Maa, did you have your lunch?
204320	206320	Or are you waiting for me to turn up?
206320	209040	How could I have my meal without you, my dear son?
209040	210600	We both will have it together.
210600	214400	I overheard you and your father talking about something this morning.
214400	215400	What was that about?
215400	222560	Ah Maa, you always pesters me to study and does not listen to whatever I say.
222560	223560	No dear.
223560	224560	Do not say this.
225040	227560	You need to do something productive in life.
227560	229440	What should I do Maa?
229440	230440	Nothing Maa, son.
230440	235520	We have one of the best scholars in the world in our nearby village, by named Acharya Vishnu
235520	236680	Sharma.
236680	240160	Your father wants you to go there to pursue your education.
240160	245080	And I told him that you would never deny my desire, because I am sure you are ready
245080	246080	to go.
246080	247080	Am I right?
247080	248080	How come I will go Maa?
248080	250840	You know I am not interested in studies at all.
250840	252160	Don't worry my son.
252160	254040	You need not have to study there.
254040	258440	But just go with your father and observe the environment and you come back if you don't
258440	259440	like it.
259440	264280	Sure Maa, I will go because it is your desire and to stay away from father.
264280	268200	He scolds me and pesters me to study all the time.
268200	273840	I am going only because you are saying and if I don't like it, I will come back very
273840	274840	soon.
274840	279360	Yashwant decides to go to Vishnu Sharma's ashram only to escape from his father.
279480	284640	Accordingly, Balvinder sends a message to Guruji Vishnu Sharma about their arrival.
284640	287760	Acharya used to live there with a small family.
287760	292400	A wife named Lakshmi and a small son named Aditya.
292400	299360	Lakshmi, our Zameendal Mr. Balvinder is bringing his son, master Yashwant to our ashram.
299360	303680	He will stay with us until I make him a competent person.
303680	305360	All glory to God.
305360	307960	All your disciples have achieved big in life.
307960	313080	They have earned a good name for themselves in society all because of your education.
313080	318280	And now I suggest that you please start with the same process with our son Aditya too.
318280	319960	I think it's the right age.
319960	322560	Oh sure, why not?
322560	325600	I would love to have my son as my disciple.
325600	328760	I will start the training from tomorrow.
328760	333480	Next day Balvinder arrives at Vishnu Sharma's ashram with Yashwant.
333480	336680	He met Acharya and told him.
336760	342600	Namaskar Guruji, here is my son Yashwant and I am leaving him with you in your ashram.
342600	348040	Now it is your responsibility to shape him into a wise and competent person.
348040	354200	Sure Balvinder ji, in no time your son will excel in all the areas of competency.
354200	357240	Yashwant, you should concentrate on your studies.
357240	362840	If you do what I tell you to do, you will become wise and soon you will return home
362840	364200	as a wise boy.
364600	369640	And Yashwant, meet my son Aditya.
369640	374120	He is younger to you in age but I am starting the training along with you.
374120	376440	So you both should enjoy learning.
376440	377960	Now go inside the ashram.
377960	383120	After Yashwant goes inside the ashram, Balvinder starts talking to Acharya Vishnu Sharma and
383120	384120	requested.
384120	387880	Acharya, my son is your responsibility from today.
387880	391800	I request you to teach some common sense and culture to him.
391800	392800	Good God!
393200	395360	Why do you say that Balvinder ji?
395360	398000	Your son seems well mannered Acharya.
398000	400040	He is not the person as he seems.
400040	406680	He is lazy, stubborn and does not pay attention to what I say and he thinks me as his biggest
406680	407680	enemy.
407680	411720	Hence we thought of joining our son in your ashram and training.
411720	413560	I am worried about his future.
413560	414560	I am clueless.
414560	416720	How will you change and deal with him?
416720	419360	I hope he behaves himself with you here.
419360	421360	Don't you worry.
421440	423440	Yashwant is immature.
423440	429080	He will gradually learn everything and I am confident he will be responsible and competent
429080	430080	in no time.
430080	432080	He will be wiser when you see him next.
432080	434120	I have full faith in you Guru ji.
434120	435600	I will see you soon.
435600	440960	Balvinder takes leave from Acharya and starts proceeding towards home.
440960	446200	And from the very next day morning, training started for Yashwant.
446200	452120	So, Yashwant, I am starting your training from today and you will have to be prompt
452120	456760	in your approach and should do everything by yourself.
456760	458880	That is the way of my ashram.
458880	460920	You will have to abide by rules.
460920	461920	Understand?
461920	466760	Yashwant bursts in anger after listening to Guru ji's words.
466760	470040	In a deeply saddened tone, he told Guru ji,
470040	476080	Guru ji, you are also like father, always dictating me what to do and when to do.
476120	478800	I came here to stay away from such instructions.
478800	480520	I don't want to do anything.
480520	481880	Is that so?
481880	484440	But you cannot shout at me like this way.
484440	491040	This is not your house and you will have to face the music if you do not follow my instructions.
491040	493040	Understand boy?
493040	495440	Acharya said in a stern voice,
495440	500280	Yashwant follows half-heartedly whatever the Guru instructs as he does not want to
500280	502360	go back to his father.
502360	505080	That's why there was no other way out.
505080	506560	Then one fine day,
506560	512800	Yashwant, I asked you to buy a heart a shlok yesterday and reproduce the same today.
512800	513800	Did you do that?
513800	516880	Guru ji, I have not learnt it yet.
516880	517880	Okay?
517880	520680	Don't you understand what I say?
520680	526240	I reiterated that you would have to face a punishment if you do not follow what I say
526240	532920	and read aloud the shlok for 100 times today and that is your punishment.
532920	535280	All this became an everyday routine.
535280	539680	However, Yashwant started to follow whatever Acharya said.
539680	545040	Over the period, he developed hatred towards this Guru, thinking that his Guru is consciously
545040	549840	forcing him to do all nonsense and his Guru does not love him at all.
549840	552960	This routine follows for a couple of more days.
552960	554560	Then one fine day,
554560	558880	Yashwant, we are going for a marriage to a nearby village.
558880	561560	Take care of yourself and Aditya.
561560	564040	Ask him to buy a heart all the shloks.
564040	569080	If you do not remind him about the shloks, he will play all throughout the day.
569080	572000	Play outside and waste his time.
572000	573960	I don't want that happening.
573960	574960	Alright?
574960	576520	Will you do that?
576520	578880	I will take care Guru ji.
578880	583840	Giving Aditya's responsibility to Yashwant, Vishnu Sharma leaves along with his wife to
583840	586080	a nearby village for a marriage.
586080	591480	And Yashwant deems it as a respect to take up the responsibility of his Guru's son.
591480	592480	He said,
592480	597840	Listen Aditya, Guru ji has assigned me your responsibility, so you should obey whatever
597840	600080	I say until he comes back.
600080	601600	Do you understand that?
601600	602600	Tell me.
602600	608680	Yes my dear brother, but I want to play now, so please leave me and let me play a little.
609680	614720	My dear little brother, I cannot allow you to play until you buy a heart all the shloks
614720	615720	for the day.
615720	621360	Yashwant tries his level best to mend Aditya and let him learn the shloka by showing his
621360	622360	authority.
622360	628760	But even after four days, Aditya could not get the shloka by heart, as his entire concentration
628760	630200	was on playing.
630200	633840	Evidently, Yashwant was very upset about this.
633840	634840	What is this Aditya?
635000	639400	How come you are unable to learn a small shloka despite being the son to a scholar?
639400	643280	If you do not read the shloka now, then I will have to punish you.
643280	649760	So please read it Aditya, brother, nothing is going into my head, please leave me.
649760	652000	Let me play.
652000	656640	This way Aditya does not pay attention to Yashwant's words and does not concentrate
656640	659320	on his studies and plays all the time.
659320	663800	However, Yashwant wants to try his luck for one final time.
663800	670400	So he calls up Aditya and tells him, Aditya, if you do not recite the shloka today, I
670400	671960	will punish you.
671960	672960	Understand?
672960	674240	You do whatever you want.
674240	677560	I cannot study and I will not recite the shloka.
677560	684440	Yaring up on such an arrogant answer, Yashwant loses his temper and slaps Aditya.
684440	688760	The slap was so hard that his cheek turned red.
688760	692520	Little Aditya went inside crying and started learning shloka.
692960	696720	Oh God, I slapped my Guru's son out of anger.
696720	698880	Now what will happen?
698880	700440	What will happen now?
700440	703520	Yashwant was terrified and lost in his thoughts.
703520	708400	But he observed that Aditya started reading with utmost concentration.
708400	713200	Very next day, Acharya Vishnu Sharma returned home along with his wife.
713200	717720	Subsequently, Aditya complained about Yashwant slapping him on the face.
717720	721600	Ma, ma, see, how brother slapped on my face.
721600	724960	It swelled too and it hurts a lot.
724960	728520	Oh my God, Yashwant, why did you slap this hurt?
728520	731640	It's hurt him so bad, his cheeks are red like apple.
731640	737280	Ma, I warned him many a times to recite the shloka, but he did not pay an ear to what
737280	739720	I said and played all the time.
739720	743920	So to bring him back on track, I had to slap him.
743920	752400	What do you expect me to say?
752400	757920	I entrusted Aditya's responsibility to Yashwant and he did his duty.
757920	762400	He asked our son to recite the shloka, to which he denied, so there is no other way
762400	765960	for a Guru rather than to punish the student.
765960	770160	One can pamper the kid in all other aspects, but not in studies.
770160	773440	One is not a teacher if they do not discipline the student.
773440	778040	As a teacher, one wants all the disciples to progress and achieve greater heights in
778040	779040	life.
779040	781040	Yashwant also did the same.
781040	782040	You go inside.
782040	784040	I will talk to Yashwant.
784040	789280	While listening to their conversation, Yashwant understood his Guru's intentions and remembered
789280	792520	his father, who tried to sort the issue with love.
792520	798040	His father wanted to see him grow and reach heights, but he never paid attention.
799040	802520	Acharya, you should forgive my ignorance.
802520	805200	I never understood your good intentions.
805200	810280	I developed hatred upon you and always thought you are persisting me to study, but never
810280	813480	realized it is for my bright future.
813480	815480	Now I will study hard, Guruji.
815480	819720	Yashwant, you should apologize to your parents, not to me.
819720	823040	Remember, parents are our first teachers.
823040	826360	They always wish child's good and bright future.
826360	831080	If you become wise and cultured, you would be the one to be benefited.
831080	834360	Without realizing this, you hated your parents.
834360	839440	The one who wants you to achieve greater heights will fight for your good and wants to choose
839440	841400	good and wise path.
841400	844320	Remember so as you reap.
844320	848000	Concentrate on your studies and do well in life.
848000	850800	Acharyaji, I am indebted to you.
850800	853480	Thank you for your lessons.
853480	859000	From that day onwards, he followed the footsteps of his Guru and completed his education within
859000	861920	no time and returned to his village.
861920	866960	Upon his return, he took all the responsibilities from his parents and looked after them happily
866960	867960	forever.
