1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,880
Thank you very much, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, good evening, Assalamu alaikum,

2
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,960
lovely to see you all here tonight. We are having a very entertaining night, are we not,

3
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,920
with some very interesting things being said. From the other side of the house tonight,

4
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,000
let me begin by saying, as a Muslim, as a representative of Islam, I would consider

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
myself an ambassador for Islam, a believer in Islam, a follower of Islam and its prophet.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,920
So in that capacity, let me begin by apologising to Anne-Marie for the Bali bombings, I apologise

7
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,920
for the role of my religion and me and my people, for the killing of Theo van Gogh,

8
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,920
yes, that was all of us. That was Islam, that was Muslims, that was the Quran. I mean, astonishing,

9
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:06,920
astonishing claims to make in the very first speech tonight on a day like today where the

10
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,920
Conservative Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is having to come out and point out that these

11
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,920
kind of views are anathema and I believe you're trying to stand for the Labour Party to become

12
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,920
an MP in Brighton. If you do and you make these comments, I'm guessing you'll have the

13
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,920
whip withdrawn from you, but then again, UKIP's on the rise, they'll take you, the BNP, they

14
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,920
might have something to say about your views. This is what Mehdi Hassan always does. By

15
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,920
the way, by the way, by the way, by the way, by the way, just on a factual point, since

16
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,920
we heard a lot about the second speaker about how backward we Muslims all are, on a factual

17
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,920
point, you said that Islam was born in Saudi Arabia, Islam was born in 610 AD, Saudi Arabia

18
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,920
was born in 1932 AD, so you were only 1322 years off. Not bad, not bad start there.

19
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:56,920
Talking of maths, by the way, a man named Al-Qawarizmi was one of the greatest mathematicians

20
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,920
of all time, a Muslim, worked in the golden age of Islam. He's the guy who came up with

21
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,920
not just algebra, but algorithms. Without algorithms you wouldn't have laptops. Without

22
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,920
laptops, Daniel Johnson tonight wouldn't have been able to print out his speech in which

23
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,920
he came to berate us Muslims for holding back the advance and intellectual achievements

24
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,920
of the West, which all happened without any contribution from anyone else other than the

25
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,920
Judeo-Christian people of Europe. In fact, Daniel David Levering, the author of the Pulitzer

26
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,920
Prize winning historian and author of the Golden Crucible, points out that there would

27
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,920
be no renaissance, there would be no reformation in Europe without the role played by Ibn Sina

28
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,920
and Ibn Rushd and some of the great Muslim theologians, philosophers, scientists in bringing

29
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,920
Greek tech to Europe.

30
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,920
As for this being our university, I will leave that to the imagination as to who is our

31
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:51,920
and who is there. I studied here too. An astonishing, astonishing set of speeches so far making

32
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:59,920
this case tonight. A mixture of just cherry-picked quotes, facts and figures, self-serving,

33
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:07,920
selective, a farrago of distortions, misrepresentations, misinterpretations, misquotations.

34
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,920
Daniel talked about my article in the New Statesman which got me a lot of flak where

35
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,920
I talked about the anti-Semitism that is prevalent in some parts of the Muslim community, which

36
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,920
indeed it is. Of course, I didn't say in that piece that it was caused by the religion of Islam.

37
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:26,920
In fact, modern anti-Semitism in the Middle East was imported from, finish the sentence,

38
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,920
Judeo-Christian Europe where I believe some certain bad things happened to the Jewish

39
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,920
people. In fact, Tom Friedman, Jewish American columnist in the New York Times, told me in

40
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,920
this very chamber last week that he believed, had Muslims been running Europe in the 1940s,

41
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,920
six million extra Jews would still be alive today. So I'm not going to take lessons in

42
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,920
anti-Semitism from someone who's here to defend the Judeo-Christian values of a continent

43
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:56,920
that murdered six million Jews. Moving swiftly on. Moving swiftly on. Yes.

44
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,920
Absolutely.

45
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,920
Well, I'm about to rate that point. No, no, no. I'm about to rate that point. You're right.

46
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:06,920
I agree with you. I agree with you. I agree with you 110%. That is my point. I don't

47
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,920
think Europe is evil or bad. I'm a very proud European. I don't want to judge Europe on

48
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,920
the basis, but if we're going to play this gutter game where we pull out the Bali bombing

49
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,920
and we pull out examples of anti-Semitism in the Islamic community, then of course I'm

50
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,920
going to come back and say, well, hold on. I mean, look, let's be very clear. Daniel

51
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,920
here was a last minute replacement for Douglas Murray who had to pull out. And Douglas and

52
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,920
I have a well-documented differences, but to be fair to Douglas, as to be fair to Anne

53
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:34,920
and to Peter, atheists. Atheists see all religions as evil, violent, threatening. The problem

54
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,920
I have with Daniel's speech is that Daniel comes here to write this robust defense of

55
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:44,920
Christianity, forgetting that his fellow Christians, people who said they were acting in the name

56
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,920
of Jesus, gave us the Crusades, the Spanish Inquisition, the anti-Jewish pogroms, European

57
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,920
colonialism in Africa and Asia, the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda, not to mention

58
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,920
countless arson and bomb attacks on abortion clinics in the United States of America to

59
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,920
this very day, I would like a little bit of humility from Daniel first before he begins

60
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,920
lecturing other communities and other faiths on violence, terror and intolerance.

61
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:13,920
But, no thank you.

62
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,920
But I would say this, to address the gentleman's very valid point here, I'm not going to play

63
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,920
that game. I don't actually believe that Christianity is a religion of violence and hate because

64
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:28,920
of what the LRA does in Uganda or what Crusaders did to Jews and Muslims in Jerusalem when

65
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,920
they took back the city in the 12th or 13th or whatever century it was. I believe that

66
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,920
Christianity, like Islam, like pretty much every mainstream religion, is based on love

67
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,920
and compassion and faith. I do follow a religion in which 113 out of the 114 chapters of the

68
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,920
Quran begins by introducing the God of Islam as a God of mercy and compassion. I would

69
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,920
not have it any other way. I don't follow a religion which introduces my God to me as

70
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:57,920
a God of war, as some kind of Greek God of wrath, as a God of hate and injustice. Not

71
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,920
at all. As Adam pointed out, you go through the Quran and you see the mercy and the love

72
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,920
and the justice. And yes, you have verses that refer to warfare and violence. Of course it

73
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,920
does. This is not a motion about pacifism. I'm not here to argue that Islam is a pacifistic

74
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:16,920
faith. It is not. Islam allows military action, violence in certain limited contexts. And

75
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:22,920
yes, a minority of Muslims do take it out of that context. But is it religious? We've

76
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,920
talked about Woolwich. Daniel and Anne-Marie have suggested that it's definitely religion

77
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:33,920
that's behind all of this. Well, actually, what I find so amusing tonight is we're having

78
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,920
a debate about Islam and the opposition tonight have come forward. We have a graduate in law,

79
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,920
a graduate in modern history, a graduate in chemistry. I admire all of their intellects

80
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,920
and their abilities, but we don't have anyone who's actually an expert on Islam, a scholar

81
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,920
of Islam, a historian of Islam, a speaker of Arabic, even a terrorism expert or a security

82
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,920
expert or a pollster, let alone to talk about what Muslims believe or think. Instead, we

83
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:01,920
have people coming here, putting forward these views, putting forward these sweeping opinions.

84
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,920
Listen to Professor Robert Pape of the University of Chicago, one of America's leading terrorism

85
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,920
experts, who, unlike our esteemed opposition tonight, studied every single case of suicide

86
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:15,920
terrorism between 1980 and 2005, 315 cases in total. And he concluded, and I quote,

87
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,920
There is little connection between suicide terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism or any

88
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,920
of the world's religions, rather what nearly all suicide terrorist attacks have in common

89
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,920
is a specific secular and strategic goal to compel modern democracies to withdraw military

90
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,920
forces from territory that the terrorists consider to be their homeland. And the irony

91
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,920
is, when we talk about terrorism, the irony is that the opposition and the Muslim terrorists,

92
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,920
the Al-Qaeda types, actually have one thing in common, because they both believe that

93
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,920
Islam is a war-like, violent religion. They both agree on that. They have everything in

94
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,920
common. Osama bin Laden would be nodding along to everything he's heard tonight from the

95
00:07:52,920 --> 00:08:00,920
opposition side. He agrees with them. The problem is, the problem is that mainstream

96
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,920
Muslims don't. The majority of Muslims around the world don't. In fact, a gentleman here

97
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,920
has started quoting all sorts of polls. Gallup carried out the biggest poll of Muslims around

98
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:16,920
the world of 50,000 Muslims in 35 countries. 93% of Muslims rejected 9-11 and suicide attacks.

99
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,920
And of the 7% who didn't, they all, when polled and focus groups, cited political

100
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,920
reasons for their support for violence, not religious reasons. And as for Islamic scholars

101
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:31,920
and what they say, well, Daniel talks about our University of Oxford. We'll go down to

102
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,920
Oxford's Centre for Islamic Studies, get hold of a man named Sheikh Afifi al-Aqiti, who

103
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,920
is a massively well-credentialed and well-respected Islamic scholar who has studied across the

104
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,920
world, who in the days after 7.7 published a fatwa denouncing terrorism in the name of

105
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,920
Islam, calling for the protection of all non-combatants at all times, and describing

106
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,920
suicide bombings as an innovation with no basis in Islamic law. Go and listen to Sheikh

107
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,920
Tahir ul-Qadri, one of Pakistan's most famous Islamic scholars, who published a 600-page

108
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,920
fatwa condemning the killing of all innocents and all suicide bombings unconditionally

109
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,920
without any ifs or buts. There's nothing new here. This is mainstream Islam, mainstream

110
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,920
scholarship, which has said this for years. You don't go out and kill people willy-nilly

111
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:16,920
in the high street or anywhere else on a bus or a mall based on verses of the Qur'an that

112
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,920
you cherry pick without any context, any understanding, any interpretation or any commentary.

113
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:34,920
I didn't say it doesn't happen at all. I never said it didn't happen. I don't blame

114
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,920
Islam. Yes, it's a very good point. And a lot of us, a lot of us are campaigning against

115
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,920
that. And we're campaigning against it in the name of Islam. We're campaigning against

116
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,920
it in the name of various interpretations of Islam. Anne-Marie comes and scares us with

117
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,920
her talk of Sharia law. I would like to see the book of Sharia law. It doesn't exist.

118
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:55,920
People argue over what Sharia law is. And you empower the extremists by saying there

119
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,920
is only one version. You empower them all. I don't believe you took any interruptions,

120
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:06,920
Anne-Marie. So I think you should stay there for a moment. Here's what we're dealing with.

121
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,920
I took your point. I took your point. Here we are dealing with a 1400 year old global

122
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,920
religion followed by 1.6 billion people in every corner of the world, a quarter of humanity

123
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,920
of all backgrounds, cultures, ethnicities. And yet the opposition tonight wants to generalize,

124
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:26,920
stereotype, smear in order to desperately win this debate. And here's my question if

125
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,920
we're going to generalize and smear. If, okay, people say yesterday's bombers, and we've

126
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,920
got to be careful, there's a trial going on, were yesterday's attackers, sorry, motivated

127
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,920
by Islam? Big debate. I don't believe they were. Let's say they were. Let's say Faisal

128
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,920
Shahzad, the Times Square bomber, was motivated by Islam. Let's assume for sake of argument

129
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,920
that Richard Reeves, the shoe bomber, was motivated by Islam. If Islam is responsible

130
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,920
for these killings, if Islam is what is motivating these people, and Islam is therefore not a

131
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,920
religion of peace or religion of war, then ask yourself this question. Why aren't the

132
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,920
rest of us doing it? Why is it such a tiny minority of Muslims are interpreting their

133
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,920
religion in the way that the opposition claim they are? Let's assume there are 16,000 suicide

134
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,920
bombers in the world. There aren't. Let's assume there are for the sake of argument.

135
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,920
That's 0.001% of the Muslim population globally. What about the other 99.99% of Muslims who

136
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,920
the opposition tonight either ignore or smear? The reality is that the rest of us aren't

137
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,920
blowing ourselves up tonight. The reality is that the opposition came here tonight not

138
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,920
worried about the fact that me and Adam might pull open our jackets and blow ourselves up

139
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,920
tonight because we're followers of a war-like warrior religion which wants to take over

140
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:36,920
Europe and Daniels University. The issue is this. The issue is this. Unless the opposition

141
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,920
can tell us tonight, and Peter Atkins is here, one of our great atheist intellectuals, can

142
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,920
tell us tonight. Can they answer this question tonight? Why don't the vast majority of

143
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,920
Muslims around the world behave as violently and aggressively as a tiny minority of politically

144
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,920
motivated extremists? Then they might as well give up and stop pretending they have

145
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,920
anything relevant to say about Islam or Muslims as a whole. Ladies and gentlemen, let me just

146
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,920
say this to you. Think about what the opposite of this motion is. If you vote no tonight,

147
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,920
think about what you're saying the opposite of this motion is. That Islam isn't a religion

148
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,920
of peace. It's a religion of war, of violence, of terror, of aggression. That the people

149
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,920
who follow Islam, me, my wife, my retired parents, my six-year-old child, that 1.8 million

150
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,920
of your fellow British residents and citizens, that 1.6 billion people across the world,

151
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:18,920
your fellow human beings, are all followers, promoters, believers in a religion of violence.

152
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,920
Do you really think that? Do you really believe that to be the case? They say that in the

153
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,920
Oxford Union the most famous debate was in 1933 when Adolf Hitler looked out for the

154
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,920
result of the King and Country motion where they voted against fighting for King and Country

155
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,920
and Hitler was listening out for the result. Well, tonight, 80 years on, there are two

156
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,920
groups of people around the world who I would argue are waiting for the result of tonight's

157
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,920
vote. There are the millions of peaceful, non-violent, law-abiding Muslims both in the

158
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,920
UK, Europe, Asia, Africa and beyond who see Islam as the source of their identity, as

159
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,920
a source of spiritual fulfilment, of hope, of solace. And there are the phobes, the haters,

160
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:56,920
the bigots out there who want to push the clash of civilisations, who want to divide

161
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:02,920
all of us into them and us and ours and their. Ladies and gentlemen, I urge you all not to

162
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,920
fuel the arguments of the phobes and bigots. Don't legitimise their divisions. Don't legitimise

163
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,920
their hate. Trust those Muslims who you know, who you've met, who you hear, who don't

164
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,920
believe in violence, who do want you to hear the peaceful message of the Quran as they

165
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,920
believe it to be taught to the majority of Muslims. The Islam of peace and compassion

166
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,920
and mercy. The Islam of the Quran, not of al-Qaeda. Ladies and gentlemen, I beg to propose

167
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,920
this motion to the House. I urge you to vote yes tonight. Thank you very much for your

168
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,920
time.

169
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,920
Thank you.
