WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:17.880
Thank you very much, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, good evening, Assalamu alaikum,

00:17.880 --> 00:21.960
lovely to see you all here tonight. We are having a very entertaining night, are we not,

00:21.960 --> 00:28.920
with some very interesting things being said. From the other side of the house tonight,

00:28.920 --> 00:34.000
let me begin by saying, as a Muslim, as a representative of Islam, I would consider

00:34.000 --> 00:41.000
myself an ambassador for Islam, a believer in Islam, a follower of Islam and its prophet.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.920
So in that capacity, let me begin by apologising to Anne-Marie for the Bali bombings, I apologise

00:46.920 --> 00:52.920
for the role of my religion and me and my people, for the killing of Theo van Gogh,

00:53.920 --> 01:00.920
yes, that was all of us. That was Islam, that was Muslims, that was the Quran. I mean, astonishing,

01:00.920 --> 01:06.920
astonishing claims to make in the very first speech tonight on a day like today where the

01:06.920 --> 01:10.920
Conservative Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is having to come out and point out that these

01:10.920 --> 01:14.920
kind of views are anathema and I believe you're trying to stand for the Labour Party to become

01:14.920 --> 01:19.920
an MP in Brighton. If you do and you make these comments, I'm guessing you'll have the

01:19.920 --> 01:24.920
whip withdrawn from you, but then again, UKIP's on the rise, they'll take you, the BNP, they

01:24.920 --> 01:29.920
might have something to say about your views. This is what Mehdi Hassan always does. By

01:29.920 --> 01:34.920
the way, by the way, by the way, by the way, by the way, just on a factual point, since

01:34.920 --> 01:38.920
we heard a lot about the second speaker about how backward we Muslims all are, on a factual

01:38.920 --> 01:43.920
point, you said that Islam was born in Saudi Arabia, Islam was born in 610 AD, Saudi Arabia

01:43.920 --> 01:50.920
was born in 1932 AD, so you were only 1322 years off. Not bad, not bad start there.

01:50.920 --> 01:56.920
Talking of maths, by the way, a man named Al-Qawarizmi was one of the greatest mathematicians

01:56.920 --> 02:00.920
of all time, a Muslim, worked in the golden age of Islam. He's the guy who came up with

02:00.920 --> 02:04.920
not just algebra, but algorithms. Without algorithms you wouldn't have laptops. Without

02:04.920 --> 02:08.920
laptops, Daniel Johnson tonight wouldn't have been able to print out his speech in which

02:08.920 --> 02:12.920
he came to berate us Muslims for holding back the advance and intellectual achievements

02:12.920 --> 02:16.920
of the West, which all happened without any contribution from anyone else other than the

02:16.920 --> 02:21.920
Judeo-Christian people of Europe. In fact, Daniel David Levering, the author of the Pulitzer

02:21.920 --> 02:24.920
Prize winning historian and author of the Golden Crucible, points out that there would

02:24.920 --> 02:28.920
be no renaissance, there would be no reformation in Europe without the role played by Ibn Sina

02:28.920 --> 02:33.920
and Ibn Rushd and some of the great Muslim theologians, philosophers, scientists in bringing

02:33.920 --> 02:39.920
Greek tech to Europe.

02:39.920 --> 02:44.920
As for this being our university, I will leave that to the imagination as to who is our

02:44.920 --> 02:51.920
and who is there. I studied here too. An astonishing, astonishing set of speeches so far making

02:51.920 --> 02:59.920
this case tonight. A mixture of just cherry-picked quotes, facts and figures, self-serving,

02:59.920 --> 03:07.920
selective, a farrago of distortions, misrepresentations, misinterpretations, misquotations.

03:07.920 --> 03:11.920
Daniel talked about my article in the New Statesman which got me a lot of flak where

03:11.920 --> 03:15.920
I talked about the anti-Semitism that is prevalent in some parts of the Muslim community, which

03:15.920 --> 03:20.920
indeed it is. Of course, I didn't say in that piece that it was caused by the religion of Islam.

03:20.920 --> 03:26.920
In fact, modern anti-Semitism in the Middle East was imported from, finish the sentence,

03:26.920 --> 03:31.920
Judeo-Christian Europe where I believe some certain bad things happened to the Jewish

03:31.920 --> 03:35.920
people. In fact, Tom Friedman, Jewish American columnist in the New York Times, told me in

03:35.920 --> 03:39.920
this very chamber last week that he believed, had Muslims been running Europe in the 1940s,

03:39.920 --> 03:43.920
six million extra Jews would still be alive today. So I'm not going to take lessons in

03:43.920 --> 03:47.920
anti-Semitism from someone who's here to defend the Judeo-Christian values of a continent

03:47.920 --> 03:56.920
that murdered six million Jews. Moving swiftly on. Moving swiftly on. Yes.

03:56.920 --> 03:57.920
Absolutely.

03:57.920 --> 03:59.920
Well, I'm about to rate that point. No, no, no. I'm about to rate that point. You're right.

03:59.920 --> 04:06.920
I agree with you. I agree with you. I agree with you 110%. That is my point. I don't

04:06.920 --> 04:10.920
think Europe is evil or bad. I'm a very proud European. I don't want to judge Europe on

04:10.920 --> 04:14.920
the basis, but if we're going to play this gutter game where we pull out the Bali bombing

04:14.920 --> 04:17.920
and we pull out examples of anti-Semitism in the Islamic community, then of course I'm

04:17.920 --> 04:20.920
going to come back and say, well, hold on. I mean, look, let's be very clear. Daniel

04:20.920 --> 04:24.920
here was a last minute replacement for Douglas Murray who had to pull out. And Douglas and

04:24.920 --> 04:28.920
I have a well-documented differences, but to be fair to Douglas, as to be fair to Anne

04:28.920 --> 04:34.920
and to Peter, atheists. Atheists see all religions as evil, violent, threatening. The problem

04:34.920 --> 04:39.920
I have with Daniel's speech is that Daniel comes here to write this robust defense of

04:39.920 --> 04:44.920
Christianity, forgetting that his fellow Christians, people who said they were acting in the name

04:44.920 --> 04:49.920
of Jesus, gave us the Crusades, the Spanish Inquisition, the anti-Jewish pogroms, European

04:49.920 --> 04:54.920
colonialism in Africa and Asia, the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda, not to mention

04:54.920 --> 04:58.920
countless arson and bomb attacks on abortion clinics in the United States of America to

04:58.920 --> 05:02.920
this very day, I would like a little bit of humility from Daniel first before he begins

05:02.920 --> 05:07.920
lecturing other communities and other faiths on violence, terror and intolerance.

05:07.920 --> 05:13.920
But, no thank you.

05:13.920 --> 05:17.920
But I would say this, to address the gentleman's very valid point here, I'm not going to play

05:17.920 --> 05:22.920
that game. I don't actually believe that Christianity is a religion of violence and hate because

05:22.920 --> 05:28.920
of what the LRA does in Uganda or what Crusaders did to Jews and Muslims in Jerusalem when

05:28.920 --> 05:32.920
they took back the city in the 12th or 13th or whatever century it was. I believe that

05:32.920 --> 05:36.920
Christianity, like Islam, like pretty much every mainstream religion, is based on love

05:36.920 --> 05:41.920
and compassion and faith. I do follow a religion in which 113 out of the 114 chapters of the

05:41.920 --> 05:46.920
Quran begins by introducing the God of Islam as a God of mercy and compassion. I would

05:46.920 --> 05:51.920
not have it any other way. I don't follow a religion which introduces my God to me as

05:51.920 --> 05:57.920
a God of war, as some kind of Greek God of wrath, as a God of hate and injustice. Not

05:57.920 --> 06:01.920
at all. As Adam pointed out, you go through the Quran and you see the mercy and the love

06:01.920 --> 06:05.920
and the justice. And yes, you have verses that refer to warfare and violence. Of course it

06:05.920 --> 06:10.920
does. This is not a motion about pacifism. I'm not here to argue that Islam is a pacifistic

06:10.920 --> 06:16.920
faith. It is not. Islam allows military action, violence in certain limited contexts. And

06:16.920 --> 06:22.920
yes, a minority of Muslims do take it out of that context. But is it religious? We've

06:22.920 --> 06:27.920
talked about Woolwich. Daniel and Anne-Marie have suggested that it's definitely religion

06:27.920 --> 06:33.920
that's behind all of this. Well, actually, what I find so amusing tonight is we're having

06:33.920 --> 06:38.920
a debate about Islam and the opposition tonight have come forward. We have a graduate in law,

06:38.920 --> 06:43.920
a graduate in modern history, a graduate in chemistry. I admire all of their intellects

06:43.920 --> 06:47.920
and their abilities, but we don't have anyone who's actually an expert on Islam, a scholar

06:47.920 --> 06:52.920
of Islam, a historian of Islam, a speaker of Arabic, even a terrorism expert or a security

06:52.920 --> 06:56.920
expert or a pollster, let alone to talk about what Muslims believe or think. Instead, we

06:56.920 --> 07:01.920
have people coming here, putting forward these views, putting forward these sweeping opinions.

07:01.920 --> 07:05.920
Listen to Professor Robert Pape of the University of Chicago, one of America's leading terrorism

07:05.920 --> 07:09.920
experts, who, unlike our esteemed opposition tonight, studied every single case of suicide

07:09.920 --> 07:15.920
terrorism between 1980 and 2005, 315 cases in total. And he concluded, and I quote,

07:16.920 --> 07:20.920
There is little connection between suicide terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism or any

07:20.920 --> 07:24.920
of the world's religions, rather what nearly all suicide terrorist attacks have in common

07:24.920 --> 07:29.920
is a specific secular and strategic goal to compel modern democracies to withdraw military

07:29.920 --> 07:34.920
forces from territory that the terrorists consider to be their homeland. And the irony

07:34.920 --> 07:39.920
is, when we talk about terrorism, the irony is that the opposition and the Muslim terrorists,

07:39.920 --> 07:44.920
the Al-Qaeda types, actually have one thing in common, because they both believe that

07:44.920 --> 07:49.920
Islam is a war-like, violent religion. They both agree on that. They have everything in

07:49.920 --> 07:52.920
common. Osama bin Laden would be nodding along to everything he's heard tonight from the

07:52.920 --> 08:00.920
opposition side. He agrees with them. The problem is, the problem is that mainstream

08:00.920 --> 08:05.920
Muslims don't. The majority of Muslims around the world don't. In fact, a gentleman here

08:05.920 --> 08:09.920
has started quoting all sorts of polls. Gallup carried out the biggest poll of Muslims around

08:09.920 --> 08:16.920
the world of 50,000 Muslims in 35 countries. 93% of Muslims rejected 9-11 and suicide attacks.

08:17.920 --> 08:22.920
And of the 7% who didn't, they all, when polled and focus groups, cited political

08:22.920 --> 08:26.920
reasons for their support for violence, not religious reasons. And as for Islamic scholars

08:26.920 --> 08:31.920
and what they say, well, Daniel talks about our University of Oxford. We'll go down to

08:31.920 --> 08:35.920
Oxford's Centre for Islamic Studies, get hold of a man named Sheikh Afifi al-Aqiti, who

08:35.920 --> 08:39.920
is a massively well-credentialed and well-respected Islamic scholar who has studied across the

08:39.920 --> 08:44.920
world, who in the days after 7.7 published a fatwa denouncing terrorism in the name of

08:44.920 --> 08:48.920
Islam, calling for the protection of all non-combatants at all times, and describing

08:48.920 --> 08:52.920
suicide bombings as an innovation with no basis in Islamic law. Go and listen to Sheikh

08:52.920 --> 08:57.920
Tahir ul-Qadri, one of Pakistan's most famous Islamic scholars, who published a 600-page

08:57.920 --> 09:01.920
fatwa condemning the killing of all innocents and all suicide bombings unconditionally

09:01.920 --> 09:06.920
without any ifs or buts. There's nothing new here. This is mainstream Islam, mainstream

09:06.920 --> 09:10.920
scholarship, which has said this for years. You don't go out and kill people willy-nilly

09:10.920 --> 09:16.920
in the high street or anywhere else on a bus or a mall based on verses of the Qur'an that

09:16.920 --> 09:21.920
you cherry pick without any context, any understanding, any interpretation or any commentary.

09:22.920 --> 09:34.920
I didn't say it doesn't happen at all. I never said it didn't happen. I don't blame

09:34.920 --> 09:38.920
Islam. Yes, it's a very good point. And a lot of us, a lot of us are campaigning against

09:38.920 --> 09:41.920
that. And we're campaigning against it in the name of Islam. We're campaigning against

09:41.920 --> 09:45.920
it in the name of various interpretations of Islam. Anne-Marie comes and scares us with

09:45.920 --> 09:48.920
her talk of Sharia law. I would like to see the book of Sharia law. It doesn't exist.

09:48.920 --> 09:55.920
People argue over what Sharia law is. And you empower the extremists by saying there

09:55.920 --> 09:58.920
is only one version. You empower them all. I don't believe you took any interruptions,

09:58.920 --> 10:06.920
Anne-Marie. So I think you should stay there for a moment. Here's what we're dealing with.

10:06.920 --> 10:10.920
I took your point. I took your point. Here we are dealing with a 1400 year old global

10:10.920 --> 10:15.920
religion followed by 1.6 billion people in every corner of the world, a quarter of humanity

10:15.920 --> 10:19.920
of all backgrounds, cultures, ethnicities. And yet the opposition tonight wants to generalize,

10:19.920 --> 10:26.920
stereotype, smear in order to desperately win this debate. And here's my question if

10:26.920 --> 10:30.920
we're going to generalize and smear. If, okay, people say yesterday's bombers, and we've

10:30.920 --> 10:34.920
got to be careful, there's a trial going on, were yesterday's attackers, sorry, motivated

10:34.920 --> 10:37.920
by Islam? Big debate. I don't believe they were. Let's say they were. Let's say Faisal

10:37.920 --> 10:42.920
Shahzad, the Times Square bomber, was motivated by Islam. Let's assume for sake of argument

10:42.920 --> 10:45.920
that Richard Reeves, the shoe bomber, was motivated by Islam. If Islam is responsible

10:45.920 --> 10:48.920
for these killings, if Islam is what is motivating these people, and Islam is therefore not a

10:48.920 --> 10:51.920
religion of peace or religion of war, then ask yourself this question. Why aren't the

10:51.920 --> 10:57.920
rest of us doing it? Why is it such a tiny minority of Muslims are interpreting their

10:57.920 --> 11:01.920
religion in the way that the opposition claim they are? Let's assume there are 16,000 suicide

11:01.920 --> 11:05.920
bombers in the world. There aren't. Let's assume there are for the sake of argument.

11:05.920 --> 11:11.920
That's 0.001% of the Muslim population globally. What about the other 99.99% of Muslims who

11:12.920 --> 11:16.920
the opposition tonight either ignore or smear? The reality is that the rest of us aren't

11:16.920 --> 11:19.920
blowing ourselves up tonight. The reality is that the opposition came here tonight not

11:19.920 --> 11:22.920
worried about the fact that me and Adam might pull open our jackets and blow ourselves up

11:22.920 --> 11:26.920
tonight because we're followers of a war-like warrior religion which wants to take over

11:26.920 --> 11:36.920
Europe and Daniels University. The issue is this. The issue is this. Unless the opposition

11:36.920 --> 11:39.920
can tell us tonight, and Peter Atkins is here, one of our great atheist intellectuals, can

11:39.920 --> 11:43.920
tell us tonight. Can they answer this question tonight? Why don't the vast majority of

11:43.920 --> 11:47.920
Muslims around the world behave as violently and aggressively as a tiny minority of politically

11:47.920 --> 11:50.920
motivated extremists? Then they might as well give up and stop pretending they have

11:50.920 --> 11:54.920
anything relevant to say about Islam or Muslims as a whole. Ladies and gentlemen, let me just

11:54.920 --> 11:58.920
say this to you. Think about what the opposite of this motion is. If you vote no tonight,

11:58.920 --> 12:00.920
think about what you're saying the opposite of this motion is. That Islam isn't a religion

12:00.920 --> 12:04.920
of peace. It's a religion of war, of violence, of terror, of aggression. That the people

12:04.920 --> 12:08.920
who follow Islam, me, my wife, my retired parents, my six-year-old child, that 1.8 million

12:08.920 --> 12:12.920
of your fellow British residents and citizens, that 1.6 billion people across the world,

12:12.920 --> 12:18.920
your fellow human beings, are all followers, promoters, believers in a religion of violence.

12:18.920 --> 12:22.920
Do you really think that? Do you really believe that to be the case? They say that in the

12:22.920 --> 12:26.920
Oxford Union the most famous debate was in 1933 when Adolf Hitler looked out for the

12:26.920 --> 12:30.920
result of the King and Country motion where they voted against fighting for King and Country

12:30.920 --> 12:34.920
and Hitler was listening out for the result. Well, tonight, 80 years on, there are two

12:34.920 --> 12:37.920
groups of people around the world who I would argue are waiting for the result of tonight's

12:37.920 --> 12:41.920
vote. There are the millions of peaceful, non-violent, law-abiding Muslims both in the

12:41.920 --> 12:46.920
UK, Europe, Asia, Africa and beyond who see Islam as the source of their identity, as

12:46.920 --> 12:50.920
a source of spiritual fulfilment, of hope, of solace. And there are the phobes, the haters,

12:50.920 --> 12:56.920
the bigots out there who want to push the clash of civilisations, who want to divide

12:56.920 --> 13:02.920
all of us into them and us and ours and their. Ladies and gentlemen, I urge you all not to

13:02.920 --> 13:07.920
fuel the arguments of the phobes and bigots. Don't legitimise their divisions. Don't legitimise

13:07.920 --> 13:12.920
their hate. Trust those Muslims who you know, who you've met, who you hear, who don't

13:12.920 --> 13:17.920
believe in violence, who do want you to hear the peaceful message of the Quran as they

13:17.920 --> 13:21.920
believe it to be taught to the majority of Muslims. The Islam of peace and compassion

13:21.920 --> 13:25.920
and mercy. The Islam of the Quran, not of al-Qaeda. Ladies and gentlemen, I beg to propose

13:25.920 --> 13:28.920
this motion to the House. I urge you to vote yes tonight. Thank you very much for your

13:28.920 --> 13:29.920
time.

13:32.920 --> 13:34.920
Thank you.
