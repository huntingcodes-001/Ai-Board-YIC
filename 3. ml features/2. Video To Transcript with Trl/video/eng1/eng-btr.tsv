0	17880	Thank you very much, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, good evening, Assalamu alaikum,
17880	21960	lovely to see you all here tonight. We are having a very entertaining night, are we not,
21960	28920	with some very interesting things being said. From the other side of the house tonight,
28920	34000	let me begin by saying, as a Muslim, as a representative of Islam, I would consider
34000	41000	myself an ambassador for Islam, a believer in Islam, a follower of Islam and its prophet.
41000	46920	So in that capacity, let me begin by apologising to Anne-Marie for the Bali bombings, I apologise
46920	52920	for the role of my religion and me and my people, for the killing of Theo van Gogh,
53920	60920	yes, that was all of us. That was Islam, that was Muslims, that was the Quran. I mean, astonishing,
60920	66920	astonishing claims to make in the very first speech tonight on a day like today where the
66920	70920	Conservative Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is having to come out and point out that these
70920	74920	kind of views are anathema and I believe you're trying to stand for the Labour Party to become
74920	79920	an MP in Brighton. If you do and you make these comments, I'm guessing you'll have the
79920	84920	whip withdrawn from you, but then again, UKIP's on the rise, they'll take you, the BNP, they
84920	89920	might have something to say about your views. This is what Mehdi Hassan always does. By
89920	94920	the way, by the way, by the way, by the way, by the way, just on a factual point, since
94920	98920	we heard a lot about the second speaker about how backward we Muslims all are, on a factual
98920	103920	point, you said that Islam was born in Saudi Arabia, Islam was born in 610 AD, Saudi Arabia
103920	110920	was born in 1932 AD, so you were only 1322 years off. Not bad, not bad start there.
110920	116920	Talking of maths, by the way, a man named Al-Qawarizmi was one of the greatest mathematicians
116920	120920	of all time, a Muslim, worked in the golden age of Islam. He's the guy who came up with
120920	124920	not just algebra, but algorithms. Without algorithms you wouldn't have laptops. Without
124920	128920	laptops, Daniel Johnson tonight wouldn't have been able to print out his speech in which
128920	132920	he came to berate us Muslims for holding back the advance and intellectual achievements
132920	136920	of the West, which all happened without any contribution from anyone else other than the
136920	141920	Judeo-Christian people of Europe. In fact, Daniel David Levering, the author of the Pulitzer
141920	144920	Prize winning historian and author of the Golden Crucible, points out that there would
144920	148920	be no renaissance, there would be no reformation in Europe without the role played by Ibn Sina
148920	153920	and Ibn Rushd and some of the great Muslim theologians, philosophers, scientists in bringing
153920	159920	Greek tech to Europe.
159920	164920	As for this being our university, I will leave that to the imagination as to who is our
164920	171920	and who is there. I studied here too. An astonishing, astonishing set of speeches so far making
171920	179920	this case tonight. A mixture of just cherry-picked quotes, facts and figures, self-serving,
179920	187920	selective, a farrago of distortions, misrepresentations, misinterpretations, misquotations.
187920	191920	Daniel talked about my article in the New Statesman which got me a lot of flak where
191920	195920	I talked about the anti-Semitism that is prevalent in some parts of the Muslim community, which
195920	200920	indeed it is. Of course, I didn't say in that piece that it was caused by the religion of Islam.
200920	206920	In fact, modern anti-Semitism in the Middle East was imported from, finish the sentence,
206920	211920	Judeo-Christian Europe where I believe some certain bad things happened to the Jewish
211920	215920	people. In fact, Tom Friedman, Jewish American columnist in the New York Times, told me in
215920	219920	this very chamber last week that he believed, had Muslims been running Europe in the 1940s,
219920	223920	six million extra Jews would still be alive today. So I'm not going to take lessons in
223920	227920	anti-Semitism from someone who's here to defend the Judeo-Christian values of a continent
227920	236920	that murdered six million Jews. Moving swiftly on. Moving swiftly on. Yes.
236920	237920	Absolutely.
237920	239920	Well, I'm about to rate that point. No, no, no. I'm about to rate that point. You're right.
239920	246920	I agree with you. I agree with you. I agree with you 110%. That is my point. I don't
246920	250920	think Europe is evil or bad. I'm a very proud European. I don't want to judge Europe on
250920	254920	the basis, but if we're going to play this gutter game where we pull out the Bali bombing
254920	257920	and we pull out examples of anti-Semitism in the Islamic community, then of course I'm
257920	260920	going to come back and say, well, hold on. I mean, look, let's be very clear. Daniel
260920	264920	here was a last minute replacement for Douglas Murray who had to pull out. And Douglas and
264920	268920	I have a well-documented differences, but to be fair to Douglas, as to be fair to Anne
268920	274920	and to Peter, atheists. Atheists see all religions as evil, violent, threatening. The problem
274920	279920	I have with Daniel's speech is that Daniel comes here to write this robust defense of
279920	284920	Christianity, forgetting that his fellow Christians, people who said they were acting in the name
284920	289920	of Jesus, gave us the Crusades, the Spanish Inquisition, the anti-Jewish pogroms, European
289920	294920	colonialism in Africa and Asia, the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda, not to mention
294920	298920	countless arson and bomb attacks on abortion clinics in the United States of America to
298920	302920	this very day, I would like a little bit of humility from Daniel first before he begins
302920	307920	lecturing other communities and other faiths on violence, terror and intolerance.
307920	313920	But, no thank you.
313920	317920	But I would say this, to address the gentleman's very valid point here, I'm not going to play
317920	322920	that game. I don't actually believe that Christianity is a religion of violence and hate because
322920	328920	of what the LRA does in Uganda or what Crusaders did to Jews and Muslims in Jerusalem when
328920	332920	they took back the city in the 12th or 13th or whatever century it was. I believe that
332920	336920	Christianity, like Islam, like pretty much every mainstream religion, is based on love
336920	341920	and compassion and faith. I do follow a religion in which 113 out of the 114 chapters of the
341920	346920	Quran begins by introducing the God of Islam as a God of mercy and compassion. I would
346920	351920	not have it any other way. I don't follow a religion which introduces my God to me as
351920	357920	a God of war, as some kind of Greek God of wrath, as a God of hate and injustice. Not
357920	361920	at all. As Adam pointed out, you go through the Quran and you see the mercy and the love
361920	365920	and the justice. And yes, you have verses that refer to warfare and violence. Of course it
365920	370920	does. This is not a motion about pacifism. I'm not here to argue that Islam is a pacifistic
370920	376920	faith. It is not. Islam allows military action, violence in certain limited contexts. And
376920	382920	yes, a minority of Muslims do take it out of that context. But is it religious? We've
382920	387920	talked about Woolwich. Daniel and Anne-Marie have suggested that it's definitely religion
387920	393920	that's behind all of this. Well, actually, what I find so amusing tonight is we're having
393920	398920	a debate about Islam and the opposition tonight have come forward. We have a graduate in law,
398920	403920	a graduate in modern history, a graduate in chemistry. I admire all of their intellects
403920	407920	and their abilities, but we don't have anyone who's actually an expert on Islam, a scholar
407920	412920	of Islam, a historian of Islam, a speaker of Arabic, even a terrorism expert or a security
412920	416920	expert or a pollster, let alone to talk about what Muslims believe or think. Instead, we
416920	421920	have people coming here, putting forward these views, putting forward these sweeping opinions.
421920	425920	Listen to Professor Robert Pape of the University of Chicago, one of America's leading terrorism
425920	429920	experts, who, unlike our esteemed opposition tonight, studied every single case of suicide
429920	435920	terrorism between 1980 and 2005, 315 cases in total. And he concluded, and I quote,
436920	440920	There is little connection between suicide terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism or any
440920	444920	of the world's religions, rather what nearly all suicide terrorist attacks have in common
444920	449920	is a specific secular and strategic goal to compel modern democracies to withdraw military
449920	454920	forces from territory that the terrorists consider to be their homeland. And the irony
454920	459920	is, when we talk about terrorism, the irony is that the opposition and the Muslim terrorists,
459920	464920	the Al-Qaeda types, actually have one thing in common, because they both believe that
464920	469920	Islam is a war-like, violent religion. They both agree on that. They have everything in
469920	472920	common. Osama bin Laden would be nodding along to everything he's heard tonight from the
472920	480920	opposition side. He agrees with them. The problem is, the problem is that mainstream
480920	485920	Muslims don't. The majority of Muslims around the world don't. In fact, a gentleman here
485920	489920	has started quoting all sorts of polls. Gallup carried out the biggest poll of Muslims around
489920	496920	the world of 50,000 Muslims in 35 countries. 93% of Muslims rejected 9-11 and suicide attacks.
497920	502920	And of the 7% who didn't, they all, when polled and focus groups, cited political
502920	506920	reasons for their support for violence, not religious reasons. And as for Islamic scholars
506920	511920	and what they say, well, Daniel talks about our University of Oxford. We'll go down to
511920	515920	Oxford's Centre for Islamic Studies, get hold of a man named Sheikh Afifi al-Aqiti, who
515920	519920	is a massively well-credentialed and well-respected Islamic scholar who has studied across the
519920	524920	world, who in the days after 7.7 published a fatwa denouncing terrorism in the name of
524920	528920	Islam, calling for the protection of all non-combatants at all times, and describing
528920	532920	suicide bombings as an innovation with no basis in Islamic law. Go and listen to Sheikh
532920	537920	Tahir ul-Qadri, one of Pakistan's most famous Islamic scholars, who published a 600-page
537920	541920	fatwa condemning the killing of all innocents and all suicide bombings unconditionally
541920	546920	without any ifs or buts. There's nothing new here. This is mainstream Islam, mainstream
546920	550920	scholarship, which has said this for years. You don't go out and kill people willy-nilly
550920	556920	in the high street or anywhere else on a bus or a mall based on verses of the Qur'an that
556920	561920	you cherry pick without any context, any understanding, any interpretation or any commentary.
562920	574920	I didn't say it doesn't happen at all. I never said it didn't happen. I don't blame
574920	578920	Islam. Yes, it's a very good point. And a lot of us, a lot of us are campaigning against
578920	581920	that. And we're campaigning against it in the name of Islam. We're campaigning against
581920	585920	it in the name of various interpretations of Islam. Anne-Marie comes and scares us with
585920	588920	her talk of Sharia law. I would like to see the book of Sharia law. It doesn't exist.
588920	595920	People argue over what Sharia law is. And you empower the extremists by saying there
595920	598920	is only one version. You empower them all. I don't believe you took any interruptions,
598920	606920	Anne-Marie. So I think you should stay there for a moment. Here's what we're dealing with.
606920	610920	I took your point. I took your point. Here we are dealing with a 1400 year old global
610920	615920	religion followed by 1.6 billion people in every corner of the world, a quarter of humanity
615920	619920	of all backgrounds, cultures, ethnicities. And yet the opposition tonight wants to generalize,
619920	626920	stereotype, smear in order to desperately win this debate. And here's my question if
626920	630920	we're going to generalize and smear. If, okay, people say yesterday's bombers, and we've
630920	634920	got to be careful, there's a trial going on, were yesterday's attackers, sorry, motivated
634920	637920	by Islam? Big debate. I don't believe they were. Let's say they were. Let's say Faisal
637920	642920	Shahzad, the Times Square bomber, was motivated by Islam. Let's assume for sake of argument
642920	645920	that Richard Reeves, the shoe bomber, was motivated by Islam. If Islam is responsible
645920	648920	for these killings, if Islam is what is motivating these people, and Islam is therefore not a
648920	651920	religion of peace or religion of war, then ask yourself this question. Why aren't the
651920	657920	rest of us doing it? Why is it such a tiny minority of Muslims are interpreting their
657920	661920	religion in the way that the opposition claim they are? Let's assume there are 16,000 suicide
661920	665920	bombers in the world. There aren't. Let's assume there are for the sake of argument.
665920	671920	That's 0.001% of the Muslim population globally. What about the other 99.99% of Muslims who
672920	676920	the opposition tonight either ignore or smear? The reality is that the rest of us aren't
676920	679920	blowing ourselves up tonight. The reality is that the opposition came here tonight not
679920	682920	worried about the fact that me and Adam might pull open our jackets and blow ourselves up
682920	686920	tonight because we're followers of a war-like warrior religion which wants to take over
686920	696920	Europe and Daniels University. The issue is this. The issue is this. Unless the opposition
696920	699920	can tell us tonight, and Peter Atkins is here, one of our great atheist intellectuals, can
699920	703920	tell us tonight. Can they answer this question tonight? Why don't the vast majority of
703920	707920	Muslims around the world behave as violently and aggressively as a tiny minority of politically
707920	710920	motivated extremists? Then they might as well give up and stop pretending they have
710920	714920	anything relevant to say about Islam or Muslims as a whole. Ladies and gentlemen, let me just
714920	718920	say this to you. Think about what the opposite of this motion is. If you vote no tonight,
718920	720920	think about what you're saying the opposite of this motion is. That Islam isn't a religion
720920	724920	of peace. It's a religion of war, of violence, of terror, of aggression. That the people
724920	728920	who follow Islam, me, my wife, my retired parents, my six-year-old child, that 1.8 million
728920	732920	of your fellow British residents and citizens, that 1.6 billion people across the world,
732920	738920	your fellow human beings, are all followers, promoters, believers in a religion of violence.
738920	742920	Do you really think that? Do you really believe that to be the case? They say that in the
742920	746920	Oxford Union the most famous debate was in 1933 when Adolf Hitler looked out for the
746920	750920	result of the King and Country motion where they voted against fighting for King and Country
750920	754920	and Hitler was listening out for the result. Well, tonight, 80 years on, there are two
754920	757920	groups of people around the world who I would argue are waiting for the result of tonight's
757920	761920	vote. There are the millions of peaceful, non-violent, law-abiding Muslims both in the
761920	766920	UK, Europe, Asia, Africa and beyond who see Islam as the source of their identity, as
766920	770920	a source of spiritual fulfilment, of hope, of solace. And there are the phobes, the haters,
770920	776920	the bigots out there who want to push the clash of civilisations, who want to divide
776920	782920	all of us into them and us and ours and their. Ladies and gentlemen, I urge you all not to
782920	787920	fuel the arguments of the phobes and bigots. Don't legitimise their divisions. Don't legitimise
787920	792920	their hate. Trust those Muslims who you know, who you've met, who you hear, who don't
792920	797920	believe in violence, who do want you to hear the peaceful message of the Quran as they
797920	801920	believe it to be taught to the majority of Muslims. The Islam of peace and compassion
801920	805920	and mercy. The Islam of the Quran, not of al-Qaeda. Ladies and gentlemen, I beg to propose
805920	808920	this motion to the House. I urge you to vote yes tonight. Thank you very much for your
808920	809920	time.
812920	814920	Thank you.
