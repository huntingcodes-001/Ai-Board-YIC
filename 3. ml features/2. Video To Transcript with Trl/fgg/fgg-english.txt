 Hello home home.  Hello, good evening class. Today we will be covering the very famous Pythagoras theorem. So what you have to understand is that in mathematics the Pythagoras theorem or the Pythagoras theorem is a fundamental relation in Euclidean geometry between the three sides of a right triangle. It states that the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse that is the  side which is opposite to our right angle. So if you can notice here this particular thing is your right angle and the side which is opposite to it is your Pythagoras theorem. Then let me just set it so that it is more visible. So this hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the square.  on both sides. So if you consider this to be C, your perpendicular will be B and your base will be A.
